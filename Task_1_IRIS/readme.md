# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification project submission for the Data Science Internship at CodSoft! The project involves implementing machine learning algorithms to classify Iris flower species based on their sepal and petal measurements. Using Python and machine learning techniques.

## Overview :
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.

Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.

## About Dataset :
The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

## Dataset used from kaggle :
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset

## Algorithms Used :
There are 3 Algorithms are used :
  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Knn - nearest Neighbours
  3. Decision Tree Classifier

## Conclusion :

Correlation analysis is a method for measuring the covariance of two random variables in a matched data set. Covariance is usually expressed as the correlation coefficient of two variables X and Y. The correlation coefficient is a unitless number that varies from -1 to +1.

There is correlation between :
1. sepal_length and sepal_width : Negative correlation with -0.11
2. sepal_width and petal_length : Negative correlation with -0.42
3. petal_length and petal_width : Positive correlation with 0.96


In this project, I explored the task of Iris Flower Classification. My analysis revealed valuable insights into the performance and effectiveness of the model in capturing the classification.

In this project, I compared three machine learning algorithms for Iris flower classification :
1. Logistic Regression : Accuracy score(Logistic Regression) : 95.56%
2. Knn - nearest Neighbours : Accuracy score(KNN - nearest neighbors) : 97.77%
3. Decision Tree Classifie r: Accuracy score(Decision tree classifer) : 93.33%

Knn - nearest Neighbours slightly outperformed the Logistic Regression & Decision Tree Classifier, indicating it was better suited for this dataset. However, All models demonstrated strong performance, confirming the effectiveness of these techniques for Iris flower classification. Future work could explore other advanced algorithms to further improve accuracy.
