# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict house prices using a dataset similar to the Boston Housing dataset.

## 📌 Project Objective
To develop predictive models that estimate median house prices based on features like crime rate, number of rooms, distance to employment centers, and more.

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains 14 attributes, including:

- `CRIM` — Crime rate
- `ZN` — Residential land zoned
- `INDUS` — Industrial proportion
- `CHAS` — Charles River dummy variable
- `NOX` — Nitric oxide concentration
- `RM` — Average number of rooms
- `AGE` — Age of buildings
- `DIS` — Distance to employment centers
- `RAD` — Accessibility to highways
- `TAX` — Property tax rate
- `PTRATIO` — Pupil-teacher ratio
- `B` — Proportion of African Americans
- `LSTAT` — % lower status population
- `MEDV` — Median house price (Target)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models
1. **Linear Regression** — A simple baseline model.
2. **Decision Tree Regressor** — Captures non-linear relationships.

## 🔍 Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score
- Feature Importance
- Actual vs. Predicted Plots

## 🖼️ Visualizations
- Correlation heatmap
- Target distribution
- Scatter plots for actual vs predicted
- Decision Tree feature importance

## 💾 Model Deployment
- Trained model is saved using `joblib`
- Can be loaded and reused for predictions

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Deployment via Flask/Streamlit
- Cross-validation for model robustness
